                                <p>A Student in WPLMS is basically any registered user on the site. All users which appear in the users table or the  WP Admin - Users are considered as student. A Student is a user who has a profile and can pursue courses in the system.</p>
                                <p>Once a user is registered on the site, the WPLMS (or any BuddyPress site) would not ackowledge it unless he/she logs in the site. Once the user is logged in, it will start appearing in the user's directory (<a href="glossary.html#users-directory" target="_blank"><b>To appear in user's directory</b></a>). So for WPLMS to recognise the user as a student, the user must login to the site at least once.</p>

                                <p>In this guide we'll learn how a student interacts at various points in the WPLMS site.  Student have lesser rights than instructors and administrators. Here are the students rights given below:</p>

                                <p>BuddyPress offers a variety of components to promote interaction among students and instructors.</p>
                                <h3 id="groups">Friends</h3>
                                  <p>If Friendship component is enabled in buddypress then a student can send friendship request to other members (students+ instructors). Friends have access to send private message and invite each other groups etc..</p>
                                  <h3 id="groups">Private Messaging</h3>
                                  <p>Private messaging allows greater interaction among students.</p>
                                  <p>Quiz and Course results are sent to users via private messaging, wherein students can directly interact with their instructor on the results.</p>
                                  <h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>
                                  <p>Groups are a very powerful component of BuddyPress which allows greater levels of interaction. Each course can be connected to a Group and while students access to course is limited but a student is a lifetime member to a course. Using external plugins like Group documents, instructor can send assignments to students via this mode.</p>
                                  <h3 id="forums">Forums</h3>
                                  <p>Each course and unit can be connected to forums. Each group can also be connected to a forum. If the group is private then the forum access is allowed only to group members. Which make the forum an exclusive forum for course members. We recommend connecting this same forum with the Groups course.</p>
